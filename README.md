**Summary:**

Hello world!

This repository is a chance for me to work on projects that I find interesting and/or preserve code that I generate through my own efforts that I find interesting.

**Background:**

I am a PhD level data scientist that currently works in industry. My PhD is in Physics from a large state university, and I have over 10 years of post graduate 
experience. 

My research and coding interests include artificial intelligence, machine learning, and mathematical physics, optimization problems, and theoretical computer science. I have
extensive experience in several machine learning subfields, including reinforcement learning, natural language processing, image recognition, time series data, and traditional
methods, including principal component analysis, tensor factorization, ensembles, and clustering.

If you want to reach me for any reason, please email: j j c 1 6 _ 1  [at]  y a h o o. c o m. If you do take the time to email me, please make sure that it's for something
intersting (or lucrative) or I am very likely to ignore you. In other words, please don't email me for help with your Coursera, etc. project. I have better things to do in life. 

Cheers!
